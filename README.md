This was my attempt to make a library that automatically did everything taught in the IS 415 (Data Analytics and Machine Learning Part 1). 

It was my gut reaction to the creation of ChatGPT. I didn't want machine learning to replace my job as a software engineer. My 22 yr old brain concluded the best and only way to respond was to use my software engineering skills to replace machine learning before it replaced me.

Turns out I didn't actually have anything to be worried about :)

This was abandoned because, in an attempt to give the programmer fine-tuned control, I realized I was essentially just rebranding/renaming the pre-existing functions in the seaborn, matplotlib, and other libraries.

I may come back to this. I learned a lot about Machine Learning and Data Analysis from this and I could stand to learn some more.
